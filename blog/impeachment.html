    <h1 data-aos="fade-right">Supreme Court Rejects Justice Yashwant Varma‚Äôs Petition</h1>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      On 7 August, 2025, the Supreme Court dismissed the writ petition filed by Allahabad High Court Judge, 
      Justice Yashwant Varma, which challenged the in-house inquiry report that indicted him in the 
      "case-at-home" scandal. The petition also questioned the recommendation made by the then Chief Justice of India 
      Sanjiv Khanna to the President and Prime Minister for Justice Varma‚Äôs removal.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      The Court declared the writ petition non-maintainable, emphasizing that Justice Varma had voluntarily participated 
      in the in-house proceedings before later questioning their validity. This conduct, according to the bench, amounted 
      to acquiescence.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      Nevertheless, due to the constitutional issues involved, such as judicial accountability and procedural fairness, 
      the bench addressed five substantive issues to offer guidance for future reference. It rejected the argument that 
      Justice Varma had a right to be heard before the report was sent to the President and Prime Minister, noting that 
      no such procedural requirement existed.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      The bench clarified that while Justice Varma had no right to a hearing at this stage, he could still defend himself 
      if impeachment proceedings are initiated.
    </p>
<h2 data-aos="fade-left">Facts of the Case</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      On March 14, during a fire-fighting operation at the official residence of Justice Varma in Delhi, 
      a large amount of cash was discovered in an outhouse. This triggered public outrage. 
      Subsequently, the then CJI Sanjiv Khanna formed an in-house inquiry committee consisting of 
      Justice Sheel Nagu, Justice G.S. Sandhawalia, and Justice Anu Sivaraman.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      Justice Varma was repatriated to the Allahabad High Court and his judicial duties were withdrawn. 
      The inquiry, which included statements from 55 witnesses and electronic evidence, found Justice Varma‚Äôs conduct 
      ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù and the cash recovery unexplained. His flat denial and claims of conspiracy were deemed insufficient.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      After refusing to resign when asked by the CJI, the report was sent to the President and Prime Minister. 
      Impeachment notices have since been circulated in Parliament with the necessary support.
