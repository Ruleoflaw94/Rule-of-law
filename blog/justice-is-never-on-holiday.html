  <h1>Justice is Never on Holiday</h1>

  <p>This year’s summer breaks of the Supreme Court of India (May 26 to July 13) marked a historic move towards strengthening the justice delivery system. This summer vacation was renamed as ‘Partial Working Days’ and expressed a strong message that justice can never be on vacation. The main objective behind implementation of such model was to address the rising pendency of cases and maintain efficiency in the justice delivery mechanism.</p>

  <p><strong>Under the PWDs framework:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>At least two benches sat every day, some days up to five benches.</li>
    <li>The registry remained operational, with fixed working hours for staff.</li>
    <li>Listings were selective, but the system was more open than previous “vacation courts.”</li>
  </ul>

  <p>With this move, the Supreme Court stepped ahead, making their vacation eventful and worthy. While the framework expresses active participation, it is also designed to maintain work-life balance and manage workload efficiently.</p>

  <blockquote>
    Justice B.R. Gavai, while heading a summer bench, remarked:  
    <em>“It’s no longer accurate to call this a vacation. We’re sitting, hearing, deciding. Justice doesn’t stop—it adjusts.”</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The success of this model is due to the collaborative efforts made by both the bench and the bar. Their active participation strongly upholds the virtue of justice. This model may not yet occupy a permanent position in the court's calendar. However, it has reframed the perception about justice and its efficient delivery. This working model has suggested that recess doesn’t mean silence—and justice can never be on recess.</p>
